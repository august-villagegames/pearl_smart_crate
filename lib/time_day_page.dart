/*
This is your main screen, the heart of your coffee shop. 
In a simple app like an alarm clock, this file will contain 
the bulk of your UI code. It'll define how your alarm clock 
looks and feels. Think of it as the layout of the coffee shop â€“ 
where the tables are, how the counter looks, and where the menu board is.
