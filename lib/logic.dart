/*
This file is where the magic happens. 
It's the kitchen of your coffee shop. 
Here, you'll handle the logic of your alarm clock: 
setting alarms, ringing them at the right time, 
and perhaps even managing snooze functionality. 
This file should be separate from your UI 
(alarm_page.dart) to keep your code clean 
and organized (a principle known as separation of concerns).
